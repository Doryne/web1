  <h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>Lignocellulosic waste streams such as spent sulfite liquor (SSL) are promising feedstocks for the sustainable production of bio-based products. SSL is a waste stream generated during sulfite pulping of wood, with a quantity of about 90 billion liters produced per year <u>(Lawford and Rousseau, 1993)</u>. The liquid contains dissolved lignosulfonates and different hemicellulose hydrolysis products, among them mannose, xylose and glucose being the main carbohydrates. Due to its high organic content SSL can pose a relevant pollution load on pulp mills. Besides of strategies for extraction of lignosulfonates or thermal recycling, different methods to convert the carbohydrate fraction into value-added products by means of fermentation have been studied. Among them are bioprocesses for yeast single cell protein <u>(Gold et al., 1981)</u> or biofuel production <u>(Pereira et al., 2013, Weissgram et al., 2015).</u> </p>

<p>In this study a recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum strain is used to utilize SSL as a substrate. Besides its importance for industrial amino acid production, genetic engineering tools enable a wide product spectrum for C. glutamicum, ranging from production of various value-added chemicals (Becker et al., 2018) to secretion of heterologous proteins <u>(Freudl, 2017, Hemmerich et al., 2019)</u>. Furthermore, advances in strain engineering for hemicellulosic sugar conversion <u>(Meiswinkel et al., 2013, Buschke et al., 2013, Choi et al., 2019)</u> make C. glutamicum a promising platform organism for SSL utilization. Bioprocessing of SSL remains challenging due to the presence of different potential growth inhibitors, reciprocal inhibition during uptake of multiple carbon substrates as well as raw material uncertainty of the SSL waste stream <u>(Unrean, 2016)</u>. Batch-to-batch variation of raw material characteristics is an important challenge for the usage of lignocellulosic waste streams and biogenic feedstocks in general <u>(Kenney et al., 2013)</u>. In addition to raw material related process input variations, cultivation trajectories can be influenced by varying inoculum size and quality <u>(Perego et al., 2003, Hornbæk et al., 2004)</u> or scale-up effects <u>(Limberg et al., 2016)</u>. Therefore, frequent information on the culture state during bioprocessing of SSL with C. glutamicum is of crucial importance for the supervision of process efficiency, online fault detection and to enable targeted control actions for improved process reproducibility.<p>

<p>Offline laboratory analysis of hemicellulosic sugars and biomass concentration is time-consuming and costly, therefore not meeting the demands for monitoring of highly dynamic fed-batch bioprocesses utilizing SSL. In-line sensors such as near infrared spectroscopy or turbidity probes can enable real-time information, however, their applicability can be strongly dependent on process conditions such as stirring parameters or media composition <u>(Kiviharju et al., 2008, Petersen et al., 2010)</u>. To achieve accurate and robust online monitoring, state estimation techniques can be used <u>(De and Maciel Filho, 2000, Simon, 2006)</u>. They enable the estimation of critical process variables such as component concentrations based on a process model and interlinked secondary measurements. Widely used estimator designs such as the extended and the unscented Kalman filter as well as the particle filter were developed to monitor nonlinear processes. Due to their ability to track highly nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian process and measurement noise characteristics, particle filters are favorable estimators for bioprocess applications <u>(Stelzer et al., 2017, Simutis and Lübbert, 2015)</u>. This study presents a new particle filter based state estimation strategy to enable noninvasive monitoring of C. glutamicum fed-batch bioprocesses utilizing SSL. Aiming for improved industrial applicability, noninvasive off-gas analytics is preferred over additional in situ probes or at-line analyses. Off-gas composition can be linked to growth and substrate conversion <u>(Aehle et al., 2011, Levisauskas et al., 1996)</U>. By applying a state estimation algorithm, process and measurement noise as well as raw material and model uncertainty can be included.</p>

<p>Although particle filtering including off-gas analysis <u>(Golabgir and Herwig, 2016, Kager et al., 2018, Kager et al., 2019)</u> gained increasing attention in the field of bioprocess technology its usage for complex substrate streams such as SSL was not yet addressed. To account for SSL raw material uncertainty during running operations, feed concentrations need to be estimated as an additional parameter. Particle filtering for simultanous process state and parameter estimation was previously described for a chemical batch reaction by Chen et al., 2005. Destro et al., 2020 recently presented a monitoring framework for simulated penicillin production processes that includes online adaption of several parameters, among them the substrate concentration in the feed. Estimation of feed input uncertainty in bioprocesses was also studied for single substrate feeds in biohydrogen <u>(Zúñiga et al., 2015)</u> and microalgae processes <u>(Rocha-Cózatl and Wouwer, 2011, Schaum and Meurer, 2015)</u>. Although these previous works included uncertainty regarding feed inputs in their developments, estimator application on multiple carbon substrates or even complex feedstocks, such as SSL, was not reported up to now. Overall, only few model-based monitoring strategies for bioprocesses utilizing lignocellulosic side streams such as wheat straw hydrolysate <u>(Lopez et al., 2020)</u> and SSL <u>(Gold et al., 1981)</u> are reported in literature. These previous works are based on additional recirculation loop or in situ probes and are not using state estimation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a new monitoring strategy that is noninvasive and includes a state estimator to better account for noisy measurements and model bias. The estimator is adaptive to SSL raw material uncertainty and able to continuously monitor multiple concentrations as well as reaction rates.</p>

<p>In the following section the experimental setup and the methodology for process modelling and estimator design is outlined. Subsequently, the process model and its application within a particle filter estimator is demonstrated. The accuracy and precision of monitored concentrations and rates is discussed with a particular focus on application under uncertainty of total sugar concentration in the SSL feedstock.</p>
